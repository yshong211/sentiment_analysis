# Sentiment Analysis for imdb movie review

Used dataset from http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ which is a IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews.

Instead of using BERT or tf-idf for NLP, I used a polarity of each words provided in the Dataset and ran a Support Vector Machine.
I was able to get 84 percent prediction rate.
